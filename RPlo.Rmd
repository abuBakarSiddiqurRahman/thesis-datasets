# Scatter Plot with 2 Variables

this plot will help to understand by getting the 
average age for each program. The data visualization
provide a quick view that which age group prefer which program.
```{r}
dat <- read.csv("HFS.csv")
library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2)

df <- group_by(dat, program_name)
df2 <- summarise(df, ageMean = mean(age))

ggplot(data = df2, mapping = aes(x = program_name, y = ageMean)) + 
  geom_point()

# This plot will give the idea which program has participated by
# a variety of age groups.
ggplot(data = dat, mapping = aes(x = program_name, y = age)) + 
  geom_point()
```
